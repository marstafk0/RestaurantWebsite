	<h2><em>About Us</em></h2>	 
	<p>Welcome to the Burger Bar! A fantastic place to hangout and watch a Sunday football game! Our burgers are made
	of quality grass-fed beef, high grade Wisconsin cheese, 
	<br />
	and fresh locally produced vegetables. We carry homebrewed beers as well as multiple varieties of IPA's and light 
	beers. Our favorite night is Tuesday night! Delicious 
	<br />
	$5 cheese curds every Tuesday along with $5 draft beer!</p>
	<p>We started this burger joint out of love for our small little hometown of Cedar Pint Minnesota. Not a bar in the
	north served a decent burger, it was all wings and 
	<br />
	onion rings. Now we serve over 100 people a night, reaching upwards of 200 on a good Friday. We're rated 4.9 across
	the books, and our staff consists of 35 hard working
	individuals.
